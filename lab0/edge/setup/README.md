# Edgemicro Setup

This directory provides scripts that configure your local environment and deploy a sample Edge Microgateway proxy to your organization on the Apigee API Platform.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed and available on your PATH (recognizable when you run, for example, <code>which curl</code>).

* cURL
* Python
* **Cygwin on Windows**: If you're running Cygwin on Windows, you'll also need the **doc2unix** utility. (The Cygwin installer lets you install the utility.) See the [Windows/Cygwin Troubleshooting] (#windowscygwin-troubleshooting) section for more information.


### Directions

1. If you do not have an account yet, [register one for free](https://accounts.apigee.com/accounts/sign_up).

2. In the file `setenv.sh`, configure values for your organization, username, environment.

3. Deploy the `edgemicro_hello` proxy. Run `deploy.sh` from the `./setup` directory.

4. When prompted, enter `edgemicro_hello`

5. Enter your org admin password when prompted.  

6. The script prompts you to provision the API product, App and developer. Type `yes` to deploy these to your Edge organization and environment.  Follow the command prompts.

You can now go to the Apigee management UI and see the deployed proxy.

Alternatively, you can invoke the proxies from the command line. To do so, cd to the `/edgemicro_hello` directory, which contains an `deploy.sh` file.
